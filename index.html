		<p><h3>Obesity vs Population Data Analysis</h3>
			
			This data visualization represents the Obesity% of each state in relation to the Percentage of the Population.  
			My analysis looked at the population data representing the Percentage of Native Born US residents at each state.
			I obtained the Obesity data from Centers of <a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq">Disease Control and Prevention website</a>.  
			I obtained the population data from <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">US Census website</a>.
			<br><br>
			In the US, obesity is a major health issue.  I wanted to see if there is any correlation of the obesity percentage 
			in relation to a particular segment of the population.  I looked at each state and gathered the percentage of the population that
			are native born in the US.  Based on the data I gathered, there is a correlation on the percentage of Native born residents vs Obesity percentage.
			It seems that the higher the Native born percentage, the higher the Obesity percentage.  There are several factors contributing to this and we
			will continue the research.
